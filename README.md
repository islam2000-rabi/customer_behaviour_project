# **Customer Behaviour Project**

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior using Jupyter Notebooks. The aim of this project is to uncover valuable insights from customer data, focusing on patterns that can help businesses understand, target, and retain their customers more effectively.

## Project Goals

- **Understand Customer Segmentation:** Identify distinct groups of customers based on their behavior.
- **Analyze Purchasing Patterns:** Explore trends and correlations among purchase frequency, amounts, and times.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Apply machine learning algorithms to forecast future customer actions (e.g., churn prediction, product recommendations).
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide strategies that businesses can implement based on analysis findings.

## Data Description

- **Source:** [Describe the data source, e.g., company CRM, online retail database, etc.]
- **Features:**  
  - Customer ID/Name  
  - Demographic info (Age, Gender, Location)

  - Engagement metrics (website/app usage, campaign responses)
- **Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Missing values handled, duplicate entries removed, variable encoding (if necessary).

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Distribution plots
    - Outlier detection
    - Correlation analysis

2. **Customer Segmentation:**
    - Visualization of segments

## Visualizations

- Interactive charts and graphs generated using libraries such as `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
- Visuals can be exported for inclusion in presentations.

---

## Key Results

- [Summarize main findings, e.g., "Identified three main customer segments: Casual, Regular, Premium."]
- [Example: "Churn risk is highest among customers with low average engagement over three months."]
- [Example: "Product recommendations improved conversion rates by 12%."]

## Recommendations

- **Focus marketing efforts on high-value segments.**
- **Introduce loyalty programs to improve retention.**
- **Personalize engagement based on predictive insights.**
